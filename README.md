# Webscraping ClinicalTrials.gov 

This code in Python 3 uses mainly Selenium and BeautifulSoup and can be helpful to extract the inclusion/exclusion criterions as well as location, center, status and enrollment of the studies. 
It picks studies with specific status values. I just kept the code as I wrote it for personal use but it can be easily tinkered for other uses.

It is commented and I believe can be considered as a tutorial for any person willing to know more about beautifulsoup or selenium to extract data.

This is my first project I post on github so please let me know if there's any suggestion to make it look better and don't hesitate to ask me any question :)!
